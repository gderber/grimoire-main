From website:
Reasons why Reiser4 is great for you:

    * Reiser4 is the fastest filesystem, and here are the benchmarks.
    * Reiser4 is an atomic filesystem, which means that your filesystem
    operations either entirely occur, or they entirely don't, and they don't
    corrupt due to half occuring. We do this without significant performance
    losses, because we invented algorithms to do it without copying the
    data twice.
    * Reiser4 uses dancing trees, which obsolete the balanced tree algorithms
    used in databases (see farther down). This makes Reiser4 more space
    efficient than other filesystems because we squish small files together
    rather than wasting space due to block alignment like they do. It also
    means that Reiser4 scales better than any other filesystem. Do you want
    a million files in a directory, and want to create them fast? No problem.
    * Reiser4 is based on plugins, which means that it will attract many
    outside contributors, and you'll be able to upgrade to their innovations
    without reformatting your disk. If you like to code, you'll really
    like plugins....
    * Reiser4 is architected for military grade security. You'll find it
    is easy to audit the code, and that assertions guard the entrance to
    every function.
