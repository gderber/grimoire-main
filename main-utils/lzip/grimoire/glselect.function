## glselect - select default libGL provider
## rewritten from smgl-gl_select
## then modified to call the latter instead, duplication == BAD
##
## this is run in FINAL and will always set the provider
## based on the final spell cast that calls this.
## If one wants to have this settable runtime then
## there's the smgl-gl_select tool to do so
